# Augmenting Medical Visualizations with AR labelling

The goal is to create an algorithm capable of annotating 3D medical models using Augmented Reality labels. The main challenge is to find a suitable compromise between a reasonably fast algorithm and an algorithm that provides the most relevant results.
